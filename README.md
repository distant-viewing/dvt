The Distant TV Toolkit is a Python package designed to facilitate the
computational analysis of visual culture. It contains low-level architecture
for applying state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to still and moving
images. The higher-level functionality of the toolkit allows users to quickly
extract semantic metadata from digitized collections. Extracted information
can be visualized for search and discovery as well as aggregated and analyzed
to find patterns across a corpus.

A quick guide for getting started is given below. More information about the
toolkit and project is available on the following pages:

* Search and discovery interface example: [DVT Video Visualization](https://www.distantviewing.org/labs/)
* Example analysis using aggregated metadata: ["Visual Style in Two Network Era Sitcoms"](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/11045-visual-style-in-two-network-era-sitcoms)
* Theory of the project: ["Distant Viewing: Analyzing Large Visual Corpora."](https://www.distantviewing.org/pdf/distant-viewing.pdf)
* Project homepage: [The Distant Viewing Lab](https://distantviewing.org)

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with the toolkit is to run the toolkit within
Google's collaboratory environment. This is a free-to-use service that allows
you to run Python code on a remote server with minimal setup. Simply select
one of the two options below to get started:

- [Collaborary Notebook with Moving Images]()
- [Collaborary Notebook with Still Images]()

For more information about setting up the toolkit on your own machine, please
see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).
